# CO2 Emissions in Layered Cranberry Soils under Simulated Warming
**Abstract:** Sanding to bury the overgrowth of uprights and promote new growth results in alternate
sand and organic sublayers in the 0–30 cm layer of cranberry soils contributing to global carbon
storage. The aim of this study was to measure CO2 emission rates in cranberry soil sublayers under
simulated warming. Soil samples (0–10, 10–20 and 20–30 cm) were incubated in jars for up to 105 days
at 10, 20 and 30 ◦C. The CO2 emission rate was measured biweekly by gas chromatography. The CO2
emission rate increased with temperature and decreased in deeper soil sublayers. Linear regression
relating CO2 efflux to soil sublayer and temperature returned R2 = 0.87. Sensitivity of organic matter
decomposition to temperature was estimated as activation energy and as Q10 coefficient, the increase
in reaction rate per 10 ◦C. Activation energy was 50 kJ mol−1, 59 kJ mol−1 and 71 kJ mol−1 in the in
the 0–10, 10–20 and 20–30 cm sublayers, respectively, indicating higher molecular-weight compounds
resisting to decomposition in deeper sublayers. The Q10 values were significantly higher (p < 0.01) in
the 10–30 cm (2.79 ± 0.10) than the 0–10 cm (2.18 ± 0.07) sublayers. The 20–30 cm sublayer where
less total carbon was stored was the most sensitive to higher temperature. Cranberry soils could be
used as sensitive markers of global warming.
